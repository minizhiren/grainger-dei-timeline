    details: `As of Fall 2018, the training is available to all faculty, but is not currently required.
  
  The Sloan University Center of Exemplary Mentoring requires admissions committee members in partnering departments, including all Grainger units, to verify having read training materials on holistic admissions and bias in reviewing applicant materials. Non-compliant departments are ineligible to nominate admitted graduate students underrepresented in STEM to the Sloan Scholarship competition. As the Sloan grant is expiring in June 2024, moving forward it will be important to institutionalize this requirement (e.g., for the GCOE SURGE fellowship competition). In Spring 2022, the College implemented such a practice by requiring completion of the graduate recruitment and retention worksheet (https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1034128800) to be eligible for SURGE funding.
  
  In spring 2022 four College personnel (Executive Associate Dean Philippe Geubelle, College Promotion and Tenure Chair Pascal Bellon, Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Lynford Goddard, and IDEA Institute Associate Director for Faculty and Staff Engagement Ellen Wang Althaus), participated in a train-the-trainer workshop organized by the Provost Office. These four facilitators then conducted workshops in fall 2022 entitled “Diversity and Equity in Promotion and Tenure” for members of the College promotion and tenure committee, department executive officers, and chairs of departmental promotion and tenure committees. The workshops will be offered annually and expanded to include all members of departmental promotion and tenure P&T committees.`,
